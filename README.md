# Project-4 The Unplanned Place: A Lifestyle Blog 

# The Initial Brainstorm 

For this project-4 our group decided to make a lifestyle blog that encompasses health, beauty, fitness as well as luxury products. We named our blog The Unplanned Place because I think a lot us can relate to ending up in places in life that our often times not on the road map we self curate for ourselves. 

Our brand statement for this project is: Simple and Clean. As each of us navigate through our daily lives we are bombarded by advertisement after advertisement with so called "influencers" claiming that their products and lifestyles really work. The goal of this blog  is provide helpful articles, reviews on products the authors use, and brands that the average person can relate to. In simple terms we want this blog to be a raw account of two average people looking to help others find relatable health, beauty, and fitness content. We also want our Brand to have inclusivity from all different backgrounds and types of people. Eventually as a long term goal we would like to contact others who may want to contribute content to our site.

For our initial brainstorming we looked at lifestyle sites and content that is already popular amongst online users. Some of those blogs included PaleoOmg
and Poosh. We wanted something that encompasses lifestyle content as well as some sort of ecommerce which in the future would be a stretch goal. 

In this project we plan to include a login for users so they can have access to save or pin content they would like to review later. We are also including a 
comment section for people to be able to engage in discussion about posts and articles they find interesting. 

We would also like to include a local business aspect of local businesses we frequent and use. As one of us lives near NYC, and the other lives in Seattle we both had plenty of experiences to collaborate on to make this project happen.
